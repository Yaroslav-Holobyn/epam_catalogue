                <p class="book-author">Jane Austen</p>

                <p class="book-description">
                    The story centers on the Bennet family, particularly the sharp-witted and independent
                    Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a society where marriage is often treated as a matter of
                    financial necessity rather than personal happiness. Under constant pressure from her
                    mother to secure a suitable match, Elizabeth navigates social expectations, family
                    obligations, and her own strong sense of morality. The arrival of the wealthy and
                    good-natured Mr. Bingley, along with his reserved and proud friend Mr. Darcy, disrupts the
                    calm order of the neighborhood. Through misunderstandings, personal growth, and moments of
                    self-reflection, the novel explores themes of class, pride, prejudice, and the true nature
                    of love.

                <p class="book-description">
                    Narrated by the wandering and reflective sailor Ishmael, this novel follows the perilous
                    journey of the whaling ship Pequod as it sails across the vast and unforgiving oceans. The
                    crew is commanded by the obsessive and enigmatic Captain Ahab, whose sole purpose is to
                    hunt down Moby Dick, the legendary white whale that maimed him years before. What begins as
                    a whaling expedition slowly transforms into a dark meditation on obsession, fate, and the
                    limits of human will. Rich in symbolism and philosophical depth, the novel examines
                    humanity’s struggle against the overwhelming power of nature.

                <p class="book-description">
                    Set in the refined yet morally conflicted world of Victorian London, the novel tells the
                    story of Dorian Gray, a young man of extraordinary beauty whose portrait is painted by the
                    artist Basil Hallward. Influenced by the cynical and hedonistic philosophy of Lord Henry
                    Wotton, Dorian becomes obsessed with youth and pleasure. After wishing that the portrait
                    would age in his place, his desire is mysteriously fulfilled. As Dorian’s outward
                    appearance remains untouched by time, the hidden painting becomes a disturbing reflection
                    of his moral decay, raising profound questions about art, beauty, and responsibility.
